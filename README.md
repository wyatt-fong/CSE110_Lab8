## Short Answer:
Graceful degradation is about making sure a website still works even if some features can’t run. Service workers help with that by handling things like caching and offline support. If a user loses internet or has a slow connection, the service worker can keep parts of the site working. So even if the “fancy stuff” fails, the basics still work—just like graceful degradation is supposed to do.
